# Summary

Overall your code is mostly well written and solid. It uses clear and descriptive variable and function names, making it easy to understand. TypeScript types are properly used to ensure type safety, which is awesome. The code is nicely modular, with the Caesar Cipher logic encapsulated in the caesar_cipher function, making it reusable and well-organized. It also handles shift values larger than 26 by wrapping them around the alphabet using the modulo operator. Overall, it's a professional and well-implemented Caesar Cipher algorithm that's easy to follow.

Below are some suggestions on where your code can be imporved...

# Correctness

### From line 5
**Type Annotations:** 
It's important to provide type annotations to function parameters and return values for better type safety. In the original code, the type parameter `<T>` for the `caesar_cipher` function was misplaced. You could instead add `<T extends string>` before the function's parameter list. This will indicate that the `string` parameter should be a subtype of `string`. This ensures that the function works correctly with string inputs and helps prevent potential type errors.

**Function Parameter Types:** 
It's important to specify the types of function parameters for clarity and type safety. In the code, the `shift` parameter is defined as `shift: string`. It would be more appropriate to specify it as `shift: number` since it represents the number of positions to shift the letters.

### From line 51
You used the "print" operator for your output. TypeScript, like JavaScript, doesn't define "print", so you should use "console.log" instead.

Here is the documentation for `console.log`:

# Efficiency

### From line 19
**Loop Iteration:** 
The code uses a *while loop* to iterate over each character in the input string. This approach works, but it might be more concise to use a *for...of loop* instead. This loop can directly iterate over the characters in the string, making the code easier to read and maintain.

Documentation of *for...of loop*:

### From line 15
**Negative Shifts:**
The code correctly checks if the shift value is greater than 26 and reduces it using the modulo operator `(shift = shift % 26)`. This ensures that the shift value remains within the range of the alphabet. However, it would be beneficial to add a check to handle negative shift values as well.

### General
**Input Validation:** 
The code assumes that the input string contains valid characters. It may be worth mentioning that the code does not handle or validate inputs containing non-alphabet characters or empty strings.

**Limitations:**
It's important to mention any limitations or assumptions made by the code. For example, the current implementation only works with uppercase letters and may not produce the desired output with lowercase letters or special characters.

# Style

### General
**Naming Conventions:** 
It's a good practice to follow consistent naming conventions. In the code, the function name `caesar_cipher` is written in *snake_case*, while the variable name `encodedText` uses *camelCase*. I would encourage you to choose one naming convention and apply it consistently throughout the code.

# Documentation

### From line 33
The code wraps around the alphabet by subtracting 26 from the shifted index if it goes beyond the range of the alphabet. It could be helpful to explain this wrapping behavior in the documentation to provide a clearer understanding of how the cipher works.

### General
Your comments really help understand what the code does. They highlight the important parts and make it easier to grasp the program and how it works. By keeping up with this approach, you'll avoid issues and ensure everyone can better understand the purpose of the code. Great job!
