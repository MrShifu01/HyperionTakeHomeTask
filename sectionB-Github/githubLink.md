### Description
This project served as our capstone project at the end of Level 2 of the Web Development Bootcamp. Its main objective was to familiarize us with Redux Toolkit for efficient state management and React components for improved code modularization.

To enhance the styling, I decided to experiment with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI, which provided me with a deeper understanding of utility classes and component libraries. Additionally, I incorporated basic animations using Animista.

Throughout the development process, I faced some challenges while learning and utilizing the useState, useEffect, useSelector, and useDispatch hooks. However, as I progressed with the project, I developed a solid understanding of these hooks and their significance in React development.

Overall, this project was an excellent challenge that I thoroughly enjoyed. It taught me the value of Redux and React in creating functional and user-friendly web applications.
